            <div class="panel-body">The 2019 Hong Kong protests, also known as the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (or Anti-ELAB) movement,
        are an ongoing series of demonstrations in Hong Kong which were triggered by the introduction of the
        Fugitive Offenders amendment bill by the Hong Kong government.
        If enacted, the bill would have let local authorities detain and extradite criminal fugitives who are wanted
        in territories with which Hong Kong does not currently have extradition agreements, including Taiwan and
        mainland China.
        The extradition bill which triggered the first protest was introduced in April. It would have allowed for
        criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China under certain circumstances.
        Opponents said this risked exposing Hong Kongers to unfair trials and violent treatment. They also argued
        the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and
        journalists.

            <div class="panel-body">Several thousand people marched in France on Saturday to protest against alarming levels of deadly domestic
            violence against women, which the president, Emmanuel Macron, has called “France’s shame”.
            The biggest rallies were in Paris. The streets of the capital became a sea of purple and white as thousands
            marched carrying banners, placards and flags calling for an end to femicide.
            About 30 marches have been organised throughout France. They involve nearly 70 organisations, political
            parties, unions and associations.
            French activists have stepped up efforts this year to call attention to the problem, with an unusual campaign of
            glueing posters around Paris and other cities every time another woman is killed.

            <div class="panel-body">The suddenness of the protests, the anger that spilled onto the streets every day, might have been surprising anywhere. But in the country often lauded as Latin America’s great economic success story, it has shocked the world.
            For three weeks, Chile has been in upheaval. One day alone, more than a million people took to the streets of Santiago, the capital.
            Perhaps the only people not shocked are Chileans. In the chaos, they see a reckoning. The promise that political leaders from the left as well as right have made for decades — that free markets would lead to prosperity, and prosperity would take care of other problems — has failed them.
            “Chile woke up,” thousands of protesters chanted one recent Sunday afternoon in Santiago’s O’Higgins Park.
